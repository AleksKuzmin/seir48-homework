// ```javascript
// planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd'); // This is only a suggested function name and signature.
//
// // console.log() shows output similar to this:
// // "You must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."
// // "Change at Union Square."
// // "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// // "7 stops in total."
// ```
//
// * The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line
// and stop that user is getting off at and prints the journey and the total number of stops for the trip in the console:
const lineL = ["8th", "6th", "Union Square", "3rd","1st"];
const lineN = ["Times Square", "34th", "28th", "23rd", "Union Square","8th"];
const line6 = ["Grand Central", "33rd", "28th", "23rd", "Union Square", "Astor Place"];



function planTrip (station1, station2) {
  // When enter station1, function counts how many stops you need to pass
}







// * Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
//
//
// #### Hints:
// * Work out how you would do it on paper first! Then start to explain that process in Javascript.
// * Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
// * Don't worry about prompting the user for input. Hard code some values to get it working. You can use
// ```prompt()``` later to make it more interactive.
// * Consider diagramming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
// * The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop. (hint: ```indexOf()```)
// * Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N
//   and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
